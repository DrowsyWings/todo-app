### Todo app

My first Todo app using REACT

Each todo in the app will have the following attributes:

- Title: The title of the todo.
- Description: A brief description of the todo.
- ID: A unique identifier for the todo.
- Completed: A flag indicating whether the todo is completed or not.

You can use these attributes to create and manage your todo list in the app.
